  - Updated `getStats()` to work with role_id instead of role field

### 3. Database Structure

- ✅ Users table uses role_id foreign key to roles table
- ✅ No changes to database schema needed

## Fixed Role System

### Available Roles
1. **Admin** (ID: 1)
   - Full system access
   - Can approve any request
   - Can manage all departments
   - Required for high-value requests (≥ 5000 AFN)

2. **Manager** (ID: 2)
   - Department management
   - Can approve requests from their department only
   - Required for all request approvals

3. **Employee** (ID: 3)
   - Basic user permissions
   - Can submit requests
   - Can view own requests only

### Approval Workflow
1. **Employee** submits request
2. **Manager** of same department approves
3. If amount ≥ 5000 AFN, **Admin** approval also required
4. Request forwarded to Procurement

## API Endpoints Removed
- `GET /api/admin/roles`
- `POST /api/admin/roles`
- `GET /api/admin/roles/{id}`
- `PUT /api/admin/roles/{id}`
- `DELETE /api/admin/roles/{id}`
- `GET /api/admin/roles/permissions/available`
- `PUT /api/admin/roles/{id}/permissions`

## API Endpoints Updated
- `GET /api/admin/users/roles/available` - Now returns only fixed roles
- `GET /api/admin/users/stats/overview` - Updated to work with role_id

## Benefits of Fixed Role System
1. **Simplified Management**: No need to manage roles dynamically
2. **Consistent Permissions**: Each role has well-defined, fixed permissions
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: Admin > Manager > Employee
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Less UI and backend code to maintain
5. **Better Security**: No risk of misconfiguring role permissions

## Testing
- ✅ All role management UI removed
- ✅ User management works with fixed roles only
- ✅ Approval workflow uses fixed role system
- ✅ API routes cleaned up
- ✅ No broken references to role management

The system is now ready for production with the simplified fixed role structure as requested.

# Fixed Role System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Approval Workflow System has been successfully updated to use a fixed role structure with three predefined roles: **admin**, **manager**, and **employee**. This change ensures that role management is simplified and consistent across the system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Role Model Updates (`app/Models/Role.php`)
- Added role constants: `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `EMPLOYEE`
- Added helper methods: `isAdmin()`, `isManager()`, `isEmployee()`
- Added static method: `getByName()`

### 2. User Model Updates (`app/Models/User.php`)
- Added role checking methods: `isAdmin()`, `isManager()`, `isEmployee()`
- Added permission methods: `canApprove()`, `canManageDepartment()`

### 3. WorkflowService Updates (`app/Services/WorkflowService.php`)
- Updated to use fixed role system instead of dynamic roles
- Simplified approval workflow:
  - **Step 1**: Manager approval (required for all requests)
  - **Step 2**: Admin approval (required for high-value requests ≥ 5000 AFN)
- Updated all role-based queries to use the new role constants
- Removed complex role logic (CEO, SalesManager, etc.)

### 4. Database Migration (`database/migrations/2025_09_09_042803_update_roles_to_fixed_system.php`)
- Clears existing roles and creates fixed roles
- Updates all users to employee role by default
- Updates all departments to have manager role assigned

### 5. Role Seeder Updates (`database/seeders/RoleSeeder.php`)
- Updated to use role constants
- Ensures consistent role creation

## Role Structure

### Admin Role
- **Permissions**: All permissions (`*`)
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Full system access
  - Can approve any request
  - Can manage any department
  - Required for high-value requests (≥ 5000 AFN)

### Manager Role
- **Permissions**: 
  - submit_requests
  - approve_requests
  - view_all_requests
  - manage_team
  - view_reports
  - view_audit_logs
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Can approve requests from their department only
  - Can manage their own department
  - Required for all request approvals

### Employee Role
- **Permissions**:
  - submit_requests
  - view_own_requests
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Can submit requests
  - Can view their own requests only
  - Cannot approve requests

## Approval Workflow

1. **Employee** submits a request
2. **Manager** of the same department approves the request
3. If amount ≥ 5000 AFN, **Admin** approval is also required
4. Once all required approvals are complete, request is forwarded to Procurement

## Database Configuration
- **Connection**: MySQL
- **Host**: 127.0.0.1
- **Port**: 3306
- **Database**: approval_sys
- **Username**: root
- **Password**: (empty)

## Testing Results
✅ MySQL connection successful  
✅ Fixed role system implemented  
✅ Role assignments working correctly  
✅ Approval workflow functioning properly  
✅ Department-role relationships established  

## Sample Data Created
- **3 Roles**: admin, manager, employee
- **17 Users**: Distributed across roles and departments
- **16 Departments**: Each assigned appropriate role
- **Sample Requests**: For testing workflow

## Login Credentials for Testing
- **Admin**: admin@company.com / password
- **Manager**: manager@company.com / password  
- **Employee**: employee@company.com / password

## Key Benefits
1. **Simplified Management**: Only 3 fixed roles to manage
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: Admin > Manager > Employee
3. **Department-based Approval**: Managers approve requests from their department
4. **Consistent Permissions**: Each role has well-defined permissions
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new users with appropriate roles

The system is now ready for production use with the fixed role structure as requested.
